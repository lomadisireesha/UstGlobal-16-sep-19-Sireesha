**********************JOINS***********************
=>first table of the records all merge with second table
 	 select * from table_name1 CROSS join table_name;
Inner join is used to obtained only matching record from the table
	select * from table_name1 INNER join table_name2 on condition //ANSI
	select * from table_name1,table_name2 where <join condition>//oracle
**************Outer Join ****************
	Left Outer Join : It is the combination of inner join and unmatched record present inside the left table
			select * from table_name 1 left outer join table_name2 on condition;//ANSI
			select * from table1,table2 where T1.col_name =T2.col_name2;//Oracle
	Right Outer Join : select * from table_name 1 right outer join table_name2 on condition;//ANSI
			select * from table1,table2 where T1.col_name =T2.col_name2;//Oracle
	Full Outer Join : It is a combination inner join and unmatched records present in the both the tables
Natural Join : It is similar to inner join where we do not specify the join. It provides output if there are common columns.
Self  Join : Joining of two same table is known as Self Joining. We use this join whenever to selected is within in the same table.
	select * from table T1 join table T2 on condition;
	select * from table T1,table T2 where condition;
**************** Key Attributes ***************
	=> the attribute with the help of which we can get a record uniquely
NON-key attribute:-
	=>all the attributes except key attributes is known as non-key attribute
Prime key:-
	=>Among the key attributes to choosen to identify the records uniquely in the table 
	=>Except prime key attributes all attribute are non-prime key
Composite Key:-
	=>the combination of two or more keys attribute which is used to identify a record uniquely
Super Key:-
	=>The set of all the key attributes are known as Super Key.
************** Functional dependency ********************
	=> A relation which exist such that attributes determine another attribute uniquely that is known as Functional dependence.
	      r->{x,y}
		x- determined//unique
		y-dependent
	1)total functional dependence:- If all the attributes of relation determined by a key attributes .
				r->{A,B,C,D}
				A-determined, {B,C,D}- dependent
	2)partial:- => A relation is said to have partial if it consist a composite key attribute
		=>their exist  a dependence such that an attribute can be determine by the other attribute which is the part of other attribute
			{AB}->{C,D}
			{A}->{B}
			{C}->{D}
	3)transistive:- A relation is said to have a transistive function
			* their exists a relation such that an attribute is determined by a non key attribute which intern is determined by key 			   attribute
